# AWS and DevOps Tasks

This repository has some ideas for basic tasks that will support your work on AWS and devops. In each case, you will need to set up a WhizLabs sandbox. You may need to enable command line credentials for the sandbox, too.

If you don't already have a sandbox running, follow these steps:
1. Using the WhizLabs credentials you have been sent, log in to [https://business.whizlabs.com/login]().
1. From the home page, navigate to `Dashboard -> My Trainings`.
1. Next to `AWS Sandbox Environment`, click `View`, and then `Access Now`
1. Select a lifetime for your sandbox (maximum nine hours).
1. Create the sandbox. Credentials for both console and programmatic access will be displayed.

You can destroy the sandbox when you are finished. However, it will automatically shut down anyway when the sandbox times out.
